Once the processing job is complete, the infrastructure used to run the job is wiped, and any temporary data stored on it is deleted.\n",

With Managed Spot, customers can benefit from up-to 90% savings in cost.\n",

For others, such as XgBoost, you will limit the max_wait_time to 3600 seconds. "

You are now ready to deploy the model and transition from experimentation into operational deployment.  To start this transition use the Git repository associated with this project to share your work with other team members. With your code under version control other team members can work to push the model into production after conducting internal review of the code as well as any QA/integration or other testing to make it production ready.\n",

Hover over `01_SageMaker-DataScientist-Workflow.ipynb` in the list of *Changed* files and click the `+` associated with the file.  Towards the bottom of the screen in the `Summary (required)` text field enter \"Completed experimentation and trained initial model\" and click `Commit`.
